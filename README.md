<h1 align="center">Advent of Polars</h1>

![It's Christmas morning. A family of polar bear cubs is in the living room, playing with toys and opening up Christmas presents. The one closest to the audience holds an advent calendar. In the background, a fireplace heats the room alongisde a decorated and lit Christmas tree. From the window, light comes in. You can see the snow and the woods. 16:9.

<p align="center">
In a land where snowflakes softly sway,<br>
Lived a family of cubs, so bright and gay.<br>
Each day in December, with glee and delight,<br>
They opened their advent, their eyes shining bright.
</p>

<p align="center">
With every flap torn, the excitement grew,<br>
For Christmas was coming, they all knew.<br>
In a cozy den, by the fire's warm glow,<br>
They dreamed of the day, amidst the snow.
</p>

<p align="center">
The fireplace crackled, spreading cheer,<br>
As Christmas morning finally drew near.<br>
Outside, the world was a wonderland white,<br>
Snow-covered treetops, a magical sight.
</p>

<p align="center">
At dawn, the cubs awoke with a cheer,<br>
For the day they'd awaited was finally here.<br>
Around a tree, with presents galore,<br>
They gathered with joy, their hearts did soar.
</p>

<p align="center">
With tiny paws, they unwrapped each gift,<br>
Their spirits high, their moods did lift.<br>
Toys and treats, all laid with care,<br>
In their snowy home, love was everywhere.
</p>

<p align="center">
On this day of joy, of peace, and fun,<br>
The polar bear cubs played, each and every one.<br>
In the heart of winter, under the sky so vast,<br>
A Christmas memory, forever to last.
</p>

## Notes

Trying to do advent of code with Polars

Did day 1 and day 2

Day 3, I did in pure Python, but couldn't figure out how to do it purely in Polars
without `map_elements` or iterating over rows in Python.

Curious to see how far Polars can take us in advent of code.

PRs to improve solutions (or add pure Polars solutions I missed) are very welcome.
