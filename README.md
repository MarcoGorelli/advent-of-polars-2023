<h1 align="center">Advent of Polars</h1>

![It's Christmas morning. A family of polar bear cubs is in the living room, playing with toys and opening up Christmas presents. The one closest to the audience holds an advent calendar. In the background, a fireplace heats the room alongisde a decorated and lit Christmas tree. From the window, light comes in. You can see the snow and the woods. 16:9. Pixar style.](./public/advent-of-polars.png)


## Notes

Trying to do advent of code with Polars, curious to see how far it can go.

PRs to improve solutions (or add pure Polars solutions I missed) are very welcome.

---

To run:
- `make venv`
- `make install-release` (or just `make install` if you don't intend to time solutions)
- `python part_3_1.py` (or whichever other part you want to run)
