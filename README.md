Trying to do advent of code with Polars

Did day 1 and day 2

Day 3, I did in pure Python, but couldn't figure out how to do it purely in Polars
without `map_elements` or iterating over rows in Python.

Curious to see how far Polars can take us in advent of code.

PRs to improve solutions (or add pure Polars solutions I missed) are very welcome.
