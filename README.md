<h1 align="center">Advent of Polars</h1>

![It's Christmas morning. A family of polar bear cubs is in the living room, playing with toys and opening up Christmas presents. The one closest to the audience holds an advent calendar. In the background, a fireplace heats the room alongisde a decorated and lit Christmas tree. From the window, light comes in. You can see the snow and the woods. 16:9.

## Notes

Trying to do advent of code with Polars

Did day 1 and day 2

Day 3, I did in pure Python, but couldn't figure out how to do it purely in Polars
without `map_elements` or iterating over rows in Python.

Curious to see how far Polars can take us in advent of code.

PRs to improve solutions (or add pure Polars solutions I missed) are very welcome.
